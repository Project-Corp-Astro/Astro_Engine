    - User's business role (CEO, Manager, Employee)
    - Company industry and size
    - Current business challenges
    - Astrological timing factors
    """
    pass
```

### 3. üîÑ Real-time Data Integration

def get_realtime_astrological_context(user_id):
    """
    Provide Astro Ratan with current context:
    - Today's transits affecting user
    - Current dasha period
    - Upcoming important dates
    - Business-relevant planetary movements
    """
    context = {
        "current_transits": get_current_transits(user_id),
        "dasha_period": get_current_dasha(user_id),
        "business_cycles": get_business_timing(user_id),

    }
    return context
```

### 4. üí¨ Conversation Flow Examples

#### Business Decision Queries
```
User: "Should I launch my new product next week?"

Astro Ratan Process:
1. Check user's business chart
2. Analyze current transits
3. Calculate product launch muhurta
4. Consider industry-specific factors
5. Provide timing recommendations

Response: "Based on your business chart, Jupiter is transiting your 10th house of career success. However, Mercury will be retrograde next week, which traditionally suggests delays in new launches. I recommend waiting until [specific date] when Mercury stations direct and forms a beneficial aspect with your natal Venus, ruler of your 2nd house of income."
```

#### Daily Guidance
```
User: "What should I focus on today?"

Astro Ratan Process:
1. Check today's panchang
2. Analyze user's current dasha
3. Review daily transits
4. Consider business priorities

Response: "Today's nakshatra is Rohini, excellent for creative endeavors and team building. Your current Jupiter dasha suggests focusing on strategic planning. The Moon in your 11th house indicates favorable networking opportunities. I suggest scheduling important meetings between 10 AM - 12 PM when the Choghadiya is most auspicious for business discussions."
